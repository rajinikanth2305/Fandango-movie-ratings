This directory contains the data behind the story Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandangoâ€™s.

In October 2015, Walt Hickey from FiveThirtyEight published a popular article(https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) where he presented strong evidence which suggest that Fandango's movie rating system was biased and dishonest. In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.

here we have 2 data sets fandango_score_comaprsion.csv and movie_ratings_16_17.csv.Hickey found that there's a significant discrepancy between the number of stars displayed to users and the actual rating, which he was able to find in the HTML of the page.
